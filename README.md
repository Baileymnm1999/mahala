# Mahala

Mahala as a word means many things. In many languages it refers to a neighborhood or location. This meaning derives from the Arabic word محلة mähallä, from the root meaning ‘to settle’, ‘to occupy’. In ancient cultures hospitality involved welcoming the stranger at the host location and offering him food, shelter, and safety.

In Hebrew Mahala is often used as a name meaning tenderness and barren.

Mahala can be used to refer to the most beautiful woman whom you have ever seen.

In South Africa, Mahala is used as slang meaning free of charge.

Regardless of how you define it, Mahala applies to this project. An attempt at a beautiful, barren, nodejs backend for all to seek as a home for all their future backend projects, free of charge.
